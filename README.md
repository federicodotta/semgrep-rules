# semgrep-rules

Some Semgrep rules I developed during penetration testing.

These rules were developed quickly during my everyday activities when I could not find what I needed in the official rules repository. Consequently surely they can be improved in speed and coverage, but they do their job.

Most of them have also a "potential" version that adds more results but that increase the number of false positives. Usually, I prefer to review more false positives than to miss a finding, but depends on the specific assessment and on the number of them.

# Setup and usage instructions

1. Install [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/). 
2. Clone this github repo.
3. To use these rules, run:

```
semgrep --config PATH/TO/RULES_DIR/OR/RULE_FILE PATH/TO/FILE/FOR/SCANNING
```
